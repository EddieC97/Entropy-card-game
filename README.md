# Game Name: Entropy Card Game

## What is this game?
***"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock,"*** made famous by ***"The Big Bang Theory,"*** is a more complex version of the classic game of rock,paper,scissor. It introduces Lizard and Spock alongside the original choices in card form. Unlike traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors, where each option has a single counterpart it defeats or is defeated by, each choice in this game interacts with multiple others. This added complexity requires players to think strategically about their moves. Additionally, each player has a ***health pool (HP)***, and the goal is to reduce the opponent's HP to zero by playing cards strategically, winning rounds, and activating card effects.

## Game Rules

Each player choose a card and reveal it simultaneously. 
The Player picks the card by clicking on the card.
The outcome is determined based on specific rules:
1. Scissors cut Paper
2. Paper covers Rock
3. Rock crushes Lizard
4. Lizard poisons Spock
5. Spock smashes Scissors
6. Scissors decapitates Lizard
7. Lizard eats Paper
8. Paper disproves Spock
9. Spock vaporizes Rock
10. Rock crushes Scissors

If both players choose the same card, it results in a tie, and they continue until a winner emerges.The winner is determined by who is left standing (player that still has HP).A visual representation of the game's rules can be seen below.

## Why I chose this game as my project?

I chose this game because I wanted to expand on the rock, paper scissor logic and wanted to make the game my version by layering a card element on top. I have always been fascinated by Hearthstone (Digital collectable card game) and the game mechanic behind it.
