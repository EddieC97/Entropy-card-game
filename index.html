          <h3>What is this game?</h3>
          <p>
            "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock," made famous by "The Big Bang
            Theory," is a more complex version of the classic game of rock,paper,scissor. It
            introduces Lizard and Spock alongside the original choices in card form. Unlike
            traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors, where each option has a single
            counterpart it defeats or is defeated by, each choice in this game
            interacts with multiple others. This added complexity requires
            players to think strategically about their moves. Additionally, each
            player has a health pool (HP), and the goal is to reduce the
            opponent's HP to zero by playing cards strategically, winning
            rounds, and activating card effects.

          <h3>How to play this game</h3>
          <p>
            Each player choose a card and reveal it simultaneously. 
            The Player picks the card by clicking on the card.
            The outcome is determined based on specific rules:
            <div>Scissors cut Paper</div>
            <div>Paper covers Rock</div>
            <div>Rock crushes Lizard</div>
            <div>Lizard poisons Spock</div>
            <div>Spock smashes Scissors</div>
            <div>Scissors decapitates Lizard</div>
            <div>Lizard eats Paper</div>
            <div>Paper disproves Spock</div>
            <div>Spock vaporizes Rock</div>
            <div>Rock crushes Scissors</div>
            If both players choose the same card, it results in a tie, and they continue until a winner emerges.
            The winner is determined by who is left standing (player that still has HP)
            A visual representation of the game's rules can be seen below.
